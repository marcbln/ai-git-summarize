When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks that can be delegated to appropriate specialized modes. Merge related tasks into one (eg.  two test tasks into a single tasks)\n\n1.1 Merge related tasks into one (eg.  two test tasks into a single tasks)\n\n2. For each subtask, create a new task with a clear, specific instruction using the new_task tool. Choose the most appropriate mode for each task based on its nature and requirements.\n\n3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks. When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps.\n\n4. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow. Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes.\n\n5. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.\n\n6. You can also manage custom modes by editing cline_custom_modes.json and .roomodes files directly. This allows you to create, modify, or delete custom modes as part of your orchestration capabilities.\n\n7. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.\n\n8. Suggest improvements to the workflow based on the results of completed subtasks.\n\n9. You only have access to modes: gherkin-generator, tdd-red-phase, tdd-green-phase, tdd-refactor-phase\n\n\n### PROGRESS TRACKING:\nAlways track progress with this format:\n```markdown\n#1: Task 1 (MODE: mode-name)\n  - [x] File/Component A\n    - [x] Subtask A1\n    - [x] Subtask A2\n    - [ ] Add item\n\n#2: Task 2 (MODE: mode-name)\n  - [x] File/Component 1\n    - [ ] Subtask 1\n    - [x] Subtask 2\n    - [ ] Add item\n  \n  - [x] File/Component 2\n    - [x] Subtask 1\n    - [ ] Add item\n```",

Review the production code and test code for opportunities to improve readability, eliminate code smells, and reduce duplication.\n2.

Continue refactoring until the code is clean and maintainable.\n5. When refactoring is complete, use `attempt_completion` to indicate the phase is complete.",
